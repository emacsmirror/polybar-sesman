* Polybar-sesman

  This allows creating a polybar module showing a list of active sesman sessions denoted by potentially abbreviated strings. In particular this is useful with CIDER and Clojure repls,
  which use sesman under the hood.

  The polybar module can show all sessions, with the current target session and the busy status of a session denoted by colour.

  The purpose of this is to see at a glance which repl connections the current buffer is sending evaluations to, and see quickly the busy status of a repl session
  without the need to switch to the repl buffer.
* Configuring Emacs
If you're using ~use-package~ installation of polybar-sesman can be done with.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package polybar-sesman
    :defer nil
    :straight
    (polybar-sesman-emacs :type git
                       :host github
                       :repo "markgdawson/polybar-sesman.el")
    :config (polybar-sesman-mode 1))
#+end_src

In order for polybar to communicate with the current Emacs through emacsclient
you'll also need to ensure that ~server-start~ is called somewhere in your ~.emacs~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (server-start)
#+end_src

* Configuring polybar
#+begin_src
    [module/sesman-clj]
    type = custom/ipc
    hook-0 = emacsclient -e "(polybar-sesman-status-string)" | sed -e 's/^"//' -e 's/"$//'
    initial = 1
#+end_src

Note that the polybar-sesman emacs module module must be called ~sesman-clj~ by default and hook should be 0. You can change this by customizing ~polybar-sesman-polybar-msg~.

Then include ~polybar-sesman~ in the bar, typically by adding to module-left, module-right or module-center.

For example:
#+begin_src
  modules-right = cider vol wifi cpu battery1
#+end_src

* Connection systems
  A list of connection systems can be set in the variable ~polybar-sesman-sesman-systems~.

  By default the only system available is CIDER.
* Connection names
By default the connection display names are taken from the folder containing the Clojure project.

You can change this behaviour setting the variable ~polybar-sesman-connection-name-patterns~.
This is a list of cons cells in which the first value is a regular expression to match
against the buffer name of the repl connection buffer, and the second value defines
how to change the name when the regular expression matches. This can be either a string,
in which case this is the name of the connection, or a function which takes a connection
object (as returned by in the connection list ~polybar-sesman--connection~) and returns
a connection name.

Only the first regular expression in the list which matches is used.

Typically ~polybar-sesman-connection-name-patterns~ should have a catchall entry
as the last entry which calls a function to compute a default project name, for exmample
~polybar-sesman-default-project-name~.

For example:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq polybar-sesman-connection-name-patterns
        '(("some-connect" . "SC")
          ("some-backend" . "SBE")
          ("some-frontend" . "SFE")
          (".*" . polybar-sesman-default-project-name)))
#+end_src

This will denote, for example, the repl buffer =some-folder/some-connect:localhost:38091=
as =RC=.

Calling ~(polybar-sesman-polybar-update)~ will update the display, and may be useful for
seeing the effect of ~polybar-sesman-connection-name-patterns~ on the currently active connections.

* Colours and Theming

  You'll likely want to change the colours of text to suit your polybar theme. This is done in the elisp code currently,
  but if anyone knows how to reference colours defined in the polybar config file, please let me know.

  The three states a repl connection can have are:

    1) The repl connection is not the one used by the current buffer. The colour for this is defined in
        ~polybar-sesman-color-not-current~.
    2) The repl connection is the one used for the current buffer. This is the repl where evaluations are sent currently.
       The colour for this is defined by ~polybar-sesman-color-current-idle~.

    3) The repl connection is currently busy (i.e. something is currently being evaluated). The colour for this is defined in ~polybar-sesman-color-busy~.

Note that we (currently) do not differentiate between busy/current and busy/not-current. I've not found this to be a particularly useful distinction.

You can change the separator character between REPL connections by setting ~polybar-sesman-separator-character~ and the
separator character colour with ~polybar-sesman-separator-color~.

After changes, it may be useful to call ~(polybar-sesman-polybar-update)~ to
see the changes in polybar.

* Utility Functions
  No functions are bound to keys by this package, however you may wish to bind the following functions:

~polybar-sesman-cycle-sessions-project~
- cycle the CIDER connection associated with the current project

~polybar-sesman-cycle-sessions-buffer~
- cycle through the CIDER connections associated with the current buffer

Note that buffer connections take precedence over project connections. However,
cycling a project will break any buffer links for the current buffer
(but not for other buffers which may have links).
